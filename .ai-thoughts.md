Implement a simple 3-step solar flow:
1) Lead capture with instant rough estimate.
2) On-site readiness checklist by a volunteer/partner.
3) App-generated custom report (system size, cost, payback, CO₂), persisted in Supabase and shareable as dashboard/PDF.

Notes:
- Keep it simple (YAGNI). Use coarse formulas for estimates; can refine later.
- Persist data in Supabase tables: leads, site_visits, solar_reports.
- Allow anon inserts for leads to reduce friction; authenticated users can read/manage.
- Reuse existing UI components and style.

Implementation decisions:
- Rough yearly savings derived from bill range buckets (static table).
- Readiness score uses simple weighted factors: orientation, shading, roof angle, envelope proxy (insulation/windows).
- System size: derive from monthly kWh, sun hours, and loss factor. Costs: €/kW range. Payback from annual savings. CO₂ from kWh * 0.6 kg/kWh.

Open improvements (later):
- Fetch local irradiance and tariff dynamically.
- PDF export (use server or client render-to-PDF).
- Link leads to authenticated owners/assignments and CRM statuses.
- Add scheduling and notification flows.

~~Initial thought to reuse audits/solar_assessments for leads~~ Pivoted to dedicated lead tables to support anon capture and partner workflow cleanly.
