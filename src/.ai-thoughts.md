## 2025-11-09 — Home page as presentation
<UserIntention>
Transform the home page into an Apple-style presentation: full-screen sections, each with a short sentence, smooth scroll, minimal chrome. Use simple, focused steps and avoid over-engineering.
</UserIntention>

### Brand correction
- ~~sparxAI~~ → SolarSense (app-wide)
- Updated alt tags, titles, and any visible brand strings.

### Rationale
- A scroll-snapped vertical narrative feels like a keynote deck without needing a separate slideshow.
- Keep content minimal per section: one strong headline and a short subline.
- Reuse existing design tokens: `bg-gradient-hero`, brand colors, and large typography.

### Implementation notes
- Replaced `pages/Index.tsx` with full-viewport, `snap-y snap-mandatory` sections.
- Made `TopBar` fixed for consistent theming and quick access to Sign In.
- Sections alternate `bg-gradient-hero` and `bg-background` to give rhythm without heavy imagery.
- CTA is the final slide with clear actions: Start audit / Get solar estimate.

### Future considerations
- Add subtle fade/slide-in with IntersectionObserver for reveal effects.
- Optional per-section imagery (e.g., subtle abstract energy shapes).
- Sticky mini-progress dots on the right to indicate section position.

## Context learned
- App uses shadcn/ui components and Tailwind utilities.
- Key interactive flows: Audit wizard and Site visit form.
- Landing page already has visually appealing hero/feature sections.

## Decisions
- Add a reusable TopBar to unify headers and provide consistent navigation.
- Add sticky action bars for long forms so primary actions remain visible.
- Provide small helper texts and placeholders to reduce ambiguity.

## Changes made
- Created `components/TopBar.tsx` with optional back navigation and right-side action.
- Integrated TopBar into `pages/AuditWizard.tsx` and `pages/SiteVisit.tsx`.
- Added sticky bottom action bars to keep action buttons visible on scroll.
- Added helper text and placeholders in `SiteVisit` to guide data entry.

## Notes
- Kept design tokens consistent with existing gradients and shadcn components.
- Chose non-invasive edits to avoid breaking flows or adding heavy state.

## Future ideas (not implemented)
- Add authenticated nav with section links (Audit, Solar, Plan).
- Add per-step validation and disabled Next states in AuditWizard.
- Add drag-and-drop keyboard support enhancements in `PhotoUploadStep`.
- Create a shared `PageContainer` wrapper.

~~Consider replacing Router structure with nested layouts in App routes~~ (not necessary now).
