Improve UI/UX with small, high-impact changes. Keep it simple (YAGNI), TypeScript-first, functional style, and avoid unnecessary churn. Document reasoning and progress in ai-thoughts files.

## Context learned
- App uses shadcn/ui components and Tailwind utilities.
- Key interactive flows: Audit wizard and Site visit form.
- Landing page already has visually appealing hero/feature sections.

## Decisions
- Add a reusable TopBar to unify headers and provide consistent navigation.
- Add sticky action bars for long forms so primary actions remain visible.
- Provide small helper texts and placeholders to reduce ambiguity.

## Changes made
- Created `components/TopBar.tsx` with optional back navigation and right-side action.
- Integrated TopBar into `pages/AuditWizard.tsx` and `pages/SiteVisit.tsx`.
- Added sticky bottom action bars to keep action buttons visible on scroll.
- Added helper text and placeholders in `SiteVisit` to guide data entry.

## Notes
- Kept design tokens consistent with existing gradients and shadcn components.
- Chose non-invasive edits to avoid breaking flows or adding heavy state.

## Future ideas (not implemented)
- Add authenticated nav with section links (Audit, Solar, Plan).
- Add per-step validation and disabled Next states in AuditWizard.
- Add drag-and-drop keyboard support enhancements in `PhotoUploadStep`.
- Create a shared `PageContainer` wrapper.

~~Consider replacing Router structure with nested layouts in App routes~~ (not necessary now).
